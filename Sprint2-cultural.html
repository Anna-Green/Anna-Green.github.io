        <h1>Learning Goals</h1>
        <h2> My Plans</h2>
        <br>

        <h3>Long Term Goals</h3>
        <p> Long term, my goals are that I want a career that I can be creative in, allows me to travel or work from anywhere and is in a stable industry. 
        I am really interested in Artificial Intelligence and also Virtual Reality and gaming so I would eventually like to look into those fields in the future. </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h3>Soft Skills </h3>
        <p>
            I would like to have upskilled in things like, time-management, asking for help when needed and creating and sticking to routines and structure. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h3>Strengths and Weaknesses</h3>
        <p>
            You can look at my strengths and weaknesses <a href="Personal Values.html">Here</a> but in short terms, I am creative, fun, determined and positive. 
            My weaknesses are sometimes I get discouraged, I do not always like asking for help and I can be distracted at times. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h3>My Commitment and Routine</h3>
        <p>
            I am working on creating a routine where I work only between a certain set of hours (during foundations its 9am-5pm) so that I can enjoy a healthy life balance and not get overworked. 
            In those hours I can have breaks, but I don’t look at my phone, never have tabs open that aren’t work related and turn of all notifications on all devices. 
            I am reaching out and asking people for clarification if I don’t understand something or I’m having trouble. I know that my facilitator is there when I need to ask her something or if not, there is the Slack channel and my cohort!
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h3>The Facilitators and my future at DEV Academy</h3>
        <p>
            What I expect from the facilitation team is guided help. So, if I do have questions, instead of answering me straight away, they can provide resources to help me find the answer. I also would like to know if I am doing something wrong so that I can change it and correct my path.
All in all, I hope for new experiences, projects and learning both from myself and the team at DEV Academy. In my first 2 weeks I have already learned so much more than I ever thought I would and cant wait to see what the rest of the course is like.
