            <h3>CSS and HTML</h3>
            <br>
            <br>

            <p>
              HTML is like the skeleton of the body. It performs the role of adding structure and is what everything else is built upon. <br>
              You can see the HTML but its not necessarily the best thing to look at. CSS is the skin, hair, eyes piercings etc. <br>
              It is all placed upon the skeleton but you can change up the hair colour, add as many tattoos or piercings as you want and even change your eye colour with contact lenses. <br>
              CSS is what makes the website fun to look at.<br>
            </p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <h3>Control Flow and Loops</h3>
            <p>
              Control flow is the way in which a code is run. Just like cooking. You read the predetermined recipe (instructions) going in the correct order in order to successfully complete your task.<br>
              One element that can have an affect on control flow are somethings called loops. Just like it sounds like, a loop loops your specified instruction so essentially you will be cooking for as long as the code tells you to.<br>
              Loops allow you to run the code for as long as you would like it to or until it has met a certain condition.<br>

            </p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <h3>The DOM</h3>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>
              The DOM stands for Document Object Model. <br>
              It is a user interface that allows you to change your webpage without changing the actual HTML code. <br>
              It is essential for developers who want to alter a site. It reads the document as a tree with branches of elements, attributes and nodes that contain the HTML code. <br>
            </p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <h3>Arrays and Objects</h3>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>
              Arrays and objects are both ways that we collect and contain data. <br>
              So why do we have two and which one is better to use?<br>
              <h4>Arrays:</h4>
              Arrays are good if you have lots of single data and you want to put them into a collection. <br>
              Its also good if you need your data sorted ie: alphabetically, numbered etc…<br>
              Var sandwich = [“Lettuce”, “Tomato”, “Bread”]<br>
              <h4>Objects:</h4>
              Objects are good if you need to contain multiple pieces of data which are then broken down further into more data.<br>
              For example:<br>
              Var cat = {<br>
              “name”: “Whiskers” ,<br>
              “legs”: 4,<br>
              “tails: 1,<br>
              “enemies”: [“water”, “dogs”]<br>
              the variable cat being the object, you can store further information into the properties of how many legs the cat has etc…<br>
              So there is not one that is better to use, it just depends on your data and what your intention is.<br>

            </p>
             <br>
             <br>
             <h3>Functions</h3>
             <br>
             <br>
             <p>
              A function is a JavaScript code for performing a task (function). <br>
              It has pre-set instructions and once you have declared the function, all you must do is call it. <br>
              You can delete, replace or do whole lot more with functions including creating and declaring your own. <br>
              It can be tremendously helpful and acts as shortcuts throughout your code.<br>
             </p>
