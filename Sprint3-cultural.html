        <h3>EQ</h3>
        
        <p>
          EQ is:  Emotional Intelligence quotient
EQ is all about how we relate to others and to the world around us. <br>
Being able to Identify emotions, being able to relate to other people’s experiences and being able to talk socially with others are vital skills both in and outside of the workplace. <br>
It allows us to develop empathy and to see where people are coming from. EQ is more on the side of social and environmental intelligence rather than logistical reasoning.<br>
EQ can identify team players, leaders and creative thinkers.<br>

    <h3>IQ</h3>
    <p>
      IQ is:  Intelligence Quotient
IQ is the more about the logistics of the brain. Visual processing, working memory, math skills and fluid and quantitative reasoning belong to IQ. <br>

For many years, IQ was the preferred way to measure intelligence through standardized tests and they started testing earlier and earlier. <br>
This was the only test that confirmed how “smart” you were and how you would fare academically and in your career. <br>
In the workplace, IQ is crucial for analyzing problems, research and development and organization.<br>

  <h3>So which one is better?</h3>
  <p>
    To ask which one is better is inaccurate as we need both in order to be a well-rounded intelligent person.<br>
    Both can be learned through a process called Neuroplasticity. When we learn something new, we create new connections in our brains via neural pathways. <br>
    The more we use those pathways, the stronger they get allowing us to essentially rewire our brains, thought patterns and behaviours.<br>
