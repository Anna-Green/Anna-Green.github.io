<h1>Problem Solving Techniques and Processess</h1>
    <br>
    <h3>A problem Thatm I Came Across</h3>
    <p>
        A problem that I came across was when I created <br>
        and coded my blog on a copy rather than the original document that it was supposed to be on. <br>
        I was really confused as to why I could open it on my computer but not on the internet. <br>
        I had to go back and work through my entire progress to see where I went wrong and once I found my mistake, <br>
        it was easy to transfer all of my files from the copied document, onto the original.<br>
    </p>
    <br>       
    <h3> So What Did I Learn From This?</h3>
        <p>
            I learned that I had to pay more attention to the instructions that I was given<br> 
            and to go through all of my work throughout the process to make sure that Im where im meant to be.<br>
        </p>
    <br>
    <h3>Valuable Resources</h3>
    <br>
    <p> 
        I have learned that if I have questions, I can always ask my classmates on slack, <br>
        my facilitator during our meetings and that google is an invaluable resource.<br>
