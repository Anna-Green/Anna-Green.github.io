        <h1>Neuroplasticity</h1>
        <br>
        
            <p>
                Noun. "The ability of the brain to form and reorganize synaptic connections, <br>
                especially in response to learning or experience or following injury."<br>
                <br>
                When people understand the theory of neuroplasticity they understand that essentially<br>
                their learning and knowledge comes down to them and the work that they put into their learning.<br>
                This means that anyone is fully capable of handling their knowledge and learning processes.<br>
                <br>
                
                A way in which this will benefit me is knowing that I can learn anything I want to as long as I reinforce those ideas and keep practicing and memorizing. <br>
                I know that I can take on any form of knowledge which also helps me mentally as it gives me the confidence and the ‘not yet’ attitude.<br>
                <br>
                
            </p>
     
        <h1> Growth Mindset</h1>
        <br>
            <p>
                Growth mindset deals with our beliefs, resilience and confidence. Essentially it means that our brain can get stronger and smarter with new and challenging learning.<br>
                There are two general mindsets when thinking about one’s character. The fixed mindset and the Growth mindset.<br>
                <br>
            </p>

        <h2> The Fixed Mindset</h2>
        <br>
            <p>
                The fixed mindset is exactly as it sounds. A person believes that they were born to have certain traits, born to be smart up until a point<br>
                and that all their qualities are carved in stone and there is nothing that they can do about it.<br>
            </p>
            <br>
        
        <h2>The Growth Mindset</h2>
        <br>
            <p>
                A growth mindset is the complete opposite. It is the belief that the more challenges you face, the smarter you are becoming.<br>
                That all of your qualities, attributes and skills can be improved, and more learning can always occur.<br>
            </p>
            <br>

    
        <h2> So what does this all mean?</h2>
        <br>
            <p>
                The brain is a muscle which means the more you challenge it and use it, the stronger and stronger it becomes. <br>
                Scientists have found that a growth mindset creates a passion and drive for learning and education, the process of it, <br>
                rather than the need for approval and grades being the be all and end all. <br>
            </p>
            <br>

        <h2>My learning journey</h2>
        <br>
            <p>
                Researching Growth mindset was interesting because it was something I had heard of before, but I had not really looked into it.<br>
                I am both astounded that we had not learned about this during school as I feel it would’ve helped a lot of students with their confidence and would change their approach and feelings towards education in general. <br>
