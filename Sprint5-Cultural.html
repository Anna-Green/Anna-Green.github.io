     <h1>Learning Journey Reflection</h1>
     <p>
         <br>
        What surprised me most about learning core was that I never knew how integral it was to technology sector.<br>
        I learned about ‘how’ I learned and how to learn ‘better’ which was interesting. <br>
        <br>
        I really enjoyed the neuroplasticity section, as well as the emotional intelligence and listening and looping portion. <br>
        I never thought about soft skills before but I’m glad that I was encouraged to learn them as I think I know more<br>
        about myself and my learning style<br>
        <br>

        3 things that I have learned about myself is that I am smarter and more capable than I think, I work well when I have organised<br>
        my time and I need to stop comparing myself and my journey to others.<br>
        <br>

        The roles of values, empathy and self-awareness in learning and programming are you need to know your strengths and weaknesses<br>
        when it comes to programming and if you need help, ask for it. You need empathy to help others.<br>
        <br>
        The thing that ha surprised me most about core learning was that I really needed it to function as a programmer.<br>
        The most challenging aspects were to take a look at myself from an outsider’s point of view and to critique my learning<br>
        from the past and ‘how’ I learn. What are the best environments for me to learn in and am I more of a visual learner or critical learner?<br>
        I think that we are spending so much time on core learning is because the course is so technically dense that we have to also take care of our wellbeing too.<br>
        The time that I have spent learning about core skills has been invaluable. I learned more about myself, my learning style, taking care of myself when<br>
        coding and I think that is something that we all needed to learn.<br>
        <br>

        <h2>What Is My Long Term Goal or Career Pathway?</h2>
            <p>
                <br>
                My hope is that I can get a job as a front end or back end web developer with the beginnings in creating own apps.<br>
                I would eventually like to get into AI and Augmented reality too. I want to be in this industry because there are so many<br>
                working options (company, from home, freelancer..) and there are so many different pathways that you can take.<br>
                <br>
            </p>



        <h2>What will be my greatest strengths and limitations in bootcamp</h2>   
            <p>
                <br>
                I think my greatest strengths will be collaborating and working with others.<br>
                Being able to be in constant contact with the tutors is really handy as well. <br>
                Some limitations for me personally is grasping all of javascript and something that Im focusing on<br>
                <br>
            </p> 
        
        <h2>Biggest Non Technical challenge</h2>
            <p>
                <br>
                I think keeping the "not yet" mentality in mind is important for me. To remember that Imn still new at this <br>
                and too not put unnessecary pressure on myself.<br>
                <br>
            </p>
        
        <h2>What non technical skills would you like to see developed?</h2>
            <p>
                <br>
                I would like to get more confident in speaking infront of groups and giving and recieving feedback.<br>
                <br>
            </p>

        <h2>What are my expectations of myself during bootcamp?</h2>
            <p>
                <br>
                My expectations of myself are that if I need help, I can ask my peers or tutors. I will keep <br>
                my workload to set hours so that I have the time to rest if I need to. Its also important to <br>
                take small breaks, do some meditation and to do enough work so that at the end of the day, I can <br>
                feel good about my day.<br>
                <br>
