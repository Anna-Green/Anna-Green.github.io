                    I do agree that some of these are me but some also aren’t.
I am Maori and living and growing up in New Zealand has taught me a lot about culture and identity. <br>
This has helped me form my own values and somethings I consider very important are family, honesty, kindness, and fairness. <br>
Kindness can make a world of difference to just one person and I personally believe that its important to be kind whenever possible. <br>
                </p>
                <p>
My strengths and limitations in my learning journey: 
I love to learn new things but if I don’t understand it, I have a hard time gaining that motivation and drive to go back and re-learn it. I can get stressed and give up quite easily so I am trying to build resistance and start a ‘not-yet’ attitude towards my learning.
Once I do learn something though, I love to help and teach others who are struggling so that I can be a resource that they can depend on.
When I am focused, I love the energy of learning new skills that I can adapt to other parts of my life. </p>
<p>
One of my strengths that I am learning to develop is the ‘not-yet’ mindset and I think that that can help towards any obstacles that I may encounter both in this journey and in other parts of my life. Just knowing that I need to give myself time in order to know what I need and to not compare myself to others.
I have worked with groups of others before who were all expecting different things out of a project so I think honesty and keeping clear about the expectations of the outcomes of said project is super important. Open communication is necessary for success.
