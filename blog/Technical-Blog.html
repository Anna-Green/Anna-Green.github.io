          <h1>What is the differences between Margins, borders and padding?</h1>
          <br>
          <p>
            Every website is made up of boxes, no matter which shape is displayed there is a box around it. 
            Margins, Borders and Padding allow us to alter the look of a website but adjusting and rearranging those boxes in various widths and heights. 
            To understand them, we should look at the box model first:

          </p>

          <br>
          <h2>What is the Box Model?</h2>
          <img src="Images/MBP Image.jpg" alt="A picture of the box model" height="300" width="500">

          <p>
              The CSS Box Model is essentially made up of four components: The content, padding, border and margin.
              When you change the elements, you change how each of those four components interact with each other.
              <br>
          </p>
          <br>
          <h2>Margins</h2>
          <br>
          <img src="Images/Negative-margin-1024x508.png" alt="Text overlapping a photo" height="400" width="700">

          <p>

            Margins are the space around an element. Adjusting these would control the amount of space between each element eg the space between two images. 
            Adding a negative value would cause the elements to overlap on top of each other. As you can see in this photo, the person has changed the value to -70px in order
            for the text to overlap the photo to change the layout design.
          </p>
          <br>
          <br>

          <h2>Borders</h2>
          <br>
          <img src="Images/css-box-model.png" alt="image of all the components of a box" height="450" width="600">
          <p>
              Borders are elements that go around content, whether its a photo or text, it can be outlined in an array
              of colours, thicknesses and styles. As you can see, the border goes around the content, in between the margin and 
              the padding.
          </p>
          <br>

          <h2>Padding</h2>
          <br>
          <p>
              As with the other photos, you can see that the padding is in between the content and the border. When you change the Values
              f the padding, you change how much of the background you see which is really handy when youre working with content overlapping images
              or other elements that you want to show off. This doesnt change how close two elements (eg two images) are together, only
              how much room they have taken up, within their own designated "box".
          </p>
